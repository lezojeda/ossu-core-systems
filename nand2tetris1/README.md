# [Build a Modern Computer from First Principles: From Nand to Tetris](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer)
## Module 1: Boolean Logic
- Boolean algebra, Boolean functions, gate logic, elementary logic gates
- Hardware Description Language (HDL), hardware simulation.
- Array/group of bits -> bus, for example two input 16 bit array let's us make a 16-bit adder
- Demultiplexor -> inverse of multiplexor
### Project
Build the following gates using only Nand as primitive:
- Nand
- Not
- And
- Or
- Xor
- Mux
- DMux
- Not16
- And16
- Or16
- Mux16
- Or8Way
- Mux4Way16
- Mux8Way16
- DMux4Way
- DMux8Way
## Module 2: Boolean Arithmetic
- Binary representation of decimal numbers
- Manipulation of binary numbers
  - Addition
  - Subtraction
  - Greater than
  - Multiplication
  - Division
- Building a half, full and complete adder
- Building a "hack" ALU
## Module 3: Memory
- combinational vs sequential logic
- flip-flops
- 1-bit and multi-bit registers
- clocks and cycles
- RAM units
- counters.
## Module 4: Machine Language
- op codes
- binary machine language
- assembly
- low-level arithmetic and programming
- specification of the "Hack" machine language used in the course to manipulate a simple 16-bit instruction "Hack" von Neumann computer
## Module 5: Computer architecture
- Von Neumann and Harvard architectures
- stored program concept
- fetch-execute cycle
- data bus
- instruction bus
- CPU
- computer design
## Module 6: Assembler
- binary and symbolic machine languages
- symbol tables
- code generation
- cross assembler
- assembler implementation
