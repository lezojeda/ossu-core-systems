# [Build a Modern Computer from First Principles: From Nand to Tetris Part II](https://www.coursera.org/learn/nand2tetris2)
## Module 1: Virtual Machine
- two-tier compilationrtualization
- VMs
- stack processing
- pointers
- VM implementation and translators
### Project
Build a basic VM translator that handles a subset of the VM language: stack arithmetic and memory access (`push`/`pop`) commands
## Module 2: Virtual Machine II
- branching, functions, function-call and return
- dynamic memory management
- stack processing
- pointers
- standard mapping
- VM implementation
### Project
Complete the VM implementation started in module's 1 project by translatin the remaining commands of `label`, `function`, `goto`, `if` and `call`
## Module 3: High-Level Language
Introduces the Jack language, a simple language based on Java
- procedural programming
- object-based programming
- classes, methods, functions, constructors
- list processing
- recursion
- developing interactive applications
- graphics optimization
### Project
For this project I wrote the Conway's Game of life, which can be found [here](https://github.com/lezojeda/ossu-core-systems/blob/master/nand2tetris2/module-3-high-level-language/program/README.md). The objectives were:
- write an interactive program in Jack: A simple, Java-like, object-based programming
language
- the objective is to get acquainted with the Jack language for which a compiler is developed in the following module
## Module 4: Compiler I
- tokenizing
- grammars
- parsing
- parse trees
- XML/mark-up
- compilation
