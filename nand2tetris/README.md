# [Build a Modern Computer from First Principles: From Nand to Tetris](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer)
## Module 1: Boolean Logic
- Boolean algebra, Boolean functions, gate logic, elementary logic gates
- Hardware Description Language (HDL), hardware simulation.
- Array/group of bits -> bus, for example two input 16 bit array let's us make a 16-bit adder
- Demultiplexor -> inverse of multiplexor
### Project
Build the following gates using only Nand as primitive:
- Nand
- Not
- And
- Or
- Xor
- Mux
- DMux
- Not16
- And16
- Or16
- Mux16
- Or8Way
- Mux4Way16
- Mux8Way16
- DMux4Way
- DMux8Way
